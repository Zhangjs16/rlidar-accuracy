# rlidar-accuracy
Uses spatial joins to calculate precision, recall, and f-score assessments of lidar-derived Canopy Height Models using varying parameters (fixed-window size, CHM smoothing-window size, and lidar pulse densities) using the Local Maxima algorithm as implemented in the 'rLiDAR' R package.
